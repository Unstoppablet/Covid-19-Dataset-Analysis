This is my first analysis as a data analyst (in view), with dashboard visualization.

## Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic was first identified from an outbreak in Wuhan, China, in 2019. As of 15 July 2022, the pandemic had caused more than 560 million cases and 6.36 million confirmed deaths. It is one of the deadliest in history.

## Problem Statement
The aim, objective and purpose of this project on Covid-19 is to create awareness, insights and information concerning Covid-19. 
This project will be visualizing the impact and havoc it has caused in the whole of the world. This includes different cases from the confirmed cases to the death cases, to the rate and the recovered cases of people with Covid-19.
It wil be visualizing top 5 countries with covid-19 prevalence, bottom 5 countries with covid-19 prevalence, top 5 countries with the highest number of people that has recovered from the so called covid-19, with top 5 countries that have highest death rate.
The objective of this project is to find out how COVID-19 has really affected countries in the world.

## Data Sourcing
I got the Covid-19 dataset through 'web scraping' on GitHub. There is a feature on Excel that allow you to import your dataset from 'The Web', the term is called 'scraping', when you scrap a dataset from a source you literally just 'collect' the dataset, rather than just downloading the dataset to your local machine(laptop).

When you observe the above visual closely, you will notice that there are different things that looks interesting and explorable in it.
First if all, the dataset is a time series, and a time series is a series of values of a quantity obtained at successive times, often with equal intervals between them. You will also noticed that it has automated updates(the dataset updates itself automatically so far there is new data). The dataset lastly has datasets for confirmed cases for US and globally likewise same for death cases, it's only recovered cases that doesn't have US dataset separately.
So, proceeding I clicked on the 'confirmed global cases' firstly to scrape it as shown below, and rather than downloading it, I "View raw".

So, after viewing it, I copy the whole link as seen below;

After copying the link, I headed to my Excel 365 to import my scraped data as seen below;

Then,

Then boom!
I was taking to 'Power Query Editor', an extension environment of MS Excel, a place where #Data_Transformation takes place.

## Data Transformation

Now moving to the real deal, "Data Transformation". Here is where all the cleaning of my dataset will be done.

<img width="956" alt="transform1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88210780/179328410-86029dc2-ab49-46b2-b3b2-4ad2fc643505.PNG">

# The steps to transform or clean this dataset and be turned to a work-able data is as follows;
- Firstly, goto "Source" and remove "Columns=* * * ", this literally turns the whole dataset into "automatic update", meaning that each time there are new cases, your dataset will be automatically updated.
<img width="725" alt="transform2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88210780/179328823-3c867cf4-11a9-49b9-834b-0c3738beddf7.PNG">

- Then, "Use First Row as Headers". This will upgrade the first row of the table to the header of the table.

<img width="625" alt="transform4" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88210780/179329276-ef5f2581-1941-4590-95bb-a503b68c1592.PNG">

- Select the first '4' columns and unpivot other columns so that I can be left with only the necessary few columns needed.
![Hold down 'ctrl' key and choose the first 4 columns, then 'right-click' and pick Unpivot Other Columns](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88210780/179334052-5ac11d3f-e6ad-40f2-a9d7-95897685676c.png)

- Rename the new created column(Attribute & Value)

<img width="625" alt="transform6" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88210780/179372046-1c1fd5fb-bce3-43ac-af3c-af4e73c43717.PNG">

- Rename the first query Confirmed Cases' and "Duplicate it"
![Screenshot (40)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88210780/179406019-7c20494c-7071-4212-9f00-ab002d15b92b.png)
<img width="400" alt="transform7" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88210780/179406032-5a32232d-d3c8-4150-996e-c9b606f7451e.PNG">

- Go back to the GitHub repository and copy the 'Raw' for "Death Global", go to Power Query and navigate to the 'settings icon' at the front of "Source" then change the source link their to the new one copied for 'Death Cases' as shown below.

<img width="946" alt="transform8" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88210780/179407152-573175f4-091d-4f73-850f-842dfde842a5.PNG">

- Repeat the same step for "Recovered Global Cases", and the result be as the one shown below:

- Then, we gonna merge the 3 tables together. You will goto the 'confirmed cases' table and choose "Merge Queries as New"
<img width="175" alt="merge" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88210780/179409135-805c67c9-92b8-4c4d-99ec-5091e52d2b62.PNG">
<img width="504" alt="merge2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88210780/179418721-56db815e-8846-40dc-ae6c-2c19d1768659.PNG">

- After all the transformation, the end cleaned data looks like this:
<img width="960" alt="transform9" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88210780/179418731-8a3d87c4-6002-4370-9203-674b8babbbae.PNG">

Without getting you bored with all this story, this is the process needed in traforming your data. Yes, you can continue cleaning and transforming your data even more that I did to mine.
Now, we move to "Visualization"

## Data Visualization

This is simply the act of combining series of 'pivot charts' together and creating different 'pivot charts' with them.
Pivot charts are the visual representation of your datasets. It interprets what the data is saying clearer and expressively.
After merging and joining different pivot tables and pivot charts together, this is the end product of my analysis.

Yes, there is more I can still put into consideration, but for a starter I just need to stop here for now, lol.
