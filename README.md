#Data Sourcing
I got the Covid-19 dataset through 'web scraping' on GitHub. There is a feature on Excel that allow you to import your dataset from 'The Web', the term is called 'scraping', when you scrap a dataset from a source you literally just 'collect' the dataset, rather than just downloading the dataset to your local machine(laptop).

When you observe the above visual closely, you will notice that there are different things that looks interesting and explorable in it.
First if all, the dataset is a time series, and a time series is a series of values of a quantity obtained at successive times, often with equal intervals between them. You will also noticed that it has automated updates(the dataset updates itself automatically so far there is new data). The dataset lastly has datasets for confirmed cases for US and globally likewise same for death cases, it's only recovered cases that doesn't have US dataset separately.
So, proceeding I clicked on the 'confirmed global cases' firstly to scrape it as shown below, and rather than downloading it, I "View raw".
